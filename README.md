## Methodology

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- **Removed:**
  - Transactions with missing customer IDs.
  - Cancelled orders (negative quantities).
  - Transactions with zero or negative unit prices.
- **Derived New Features:**
  - **Total Revenue** = Quantity Ã— Unit Price.
  - **Invoice Month** = Extracted from invoice dates for time-series analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified top-selling products by revenue and quantity.
- Analyzed sales distribution across countries.
- Observed seasonal trends and monthly revenue changes.

### Feature Engineering
- Created **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM)** scores:
  - **Recency:** Days since the last purchase.
  - **Frequency:** Total number of transactions.
  - **Monetary:** Total revenue contributed by a customer.
- Standardized RFM scores for clustering.

### Customer Segmentation
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to group customers into segments based on RFM scores.
- Used **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Validated clusters using **Silhouette Scores**.
